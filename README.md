## Docker

Containers exists because:
- better isolation in a single OS
- reduced environment variables
- increase speed of change
		
```$ docker version``` - check your versions and that docker is working

```$ docker info``` - shows most configuration values for the engine

```$ docker``` - returns the list of commands
- docker \<management command\>\<sub command\>
